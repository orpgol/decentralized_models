# Repository for code used in the paper "Real-Time Decentralized knowledge Transfer at the Edge"
### In this repo you can find the experiments discussed in the paper, in addtion to methods compared with.
### The "compared_with" folder contains the 3 methods used as a comparison in the paper: Knowledge Distillaiton, Federated Learning, and Gossip Algorithms.
### The different network shapes constructed in our experiments correspond to the 3 notebooks: cifar10_multi_agent.ipynb, cifar10_multi_agent_full_mesh.ipynb, cifar10_multi_agent-transitive.ipynb.
